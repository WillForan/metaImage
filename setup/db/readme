# DATABASE TESTING 
## reset.bash

will make a back up in olddb/ and reset either by
 1. using the restoredb folder
 2. running initial_db.js 
    - manually curated from output of setup/images/imagesToJson.bash


# initial_db.js

is the toy db creator for initial testing

# restoredb

should be a folder containing good dump of the database
likely a link from olddb/....
