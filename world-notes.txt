  * /tags?term=PARTIAL fills in tags, but does so with phony data, not the db

  * ugly jquery code to tag people, present thumbnails using **300px width assumption**

* **/add/people** via post (see /image/HASH)
  * still need distiniction between a global person and how a users knows someone personally (for listing)
